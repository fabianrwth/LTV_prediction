## Comparing and combining statistical and machine learning approaches for customer lifetime value prediction in freemium settings

## Abstract
The digital games market is confronted with several challenges such as a fast growing demand and product variety, accelerated especially by the COVID-19 pandemic that forced audiences to stay home as well as the dominance of the freemium business model. The freemium business model is characterized by free-to-play games in which in-app purchases are offered to unlock new game levels, personalizations or capabilities. Albeit the majority of players use the offered products for free, they are financed by a minority of players that reimburse the product through in app purchases. Therefore, companies operating in the freemium business conduct extensive research in order to identify and retain these paying customers. A commonly applied measure to analyse customers and create predictions on their strategic decisions presents the customer Lifetime Value. This project study focuses on identifying high value customers on the one hand via a regression task to predict their total money spent and on the other hand via a classification task to classify buyers into low, medium and high spenders, each at the end of a 30 day observation period and on the basis of their usage of the app during the first three days. Moreover, two data architectures are combined as well as best practises applied to solve challenges regarding the large shares of missing data instances and highly imbalanced data resulting out of the nature of freemium business models. To further enhance the models' performances Hyperparameter Tuning is applied.
